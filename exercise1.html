         <p>On this site I really like the use of JQuery scrolling, especially on the "collections" page. There are a bunch of different elements that scroll into place at different times which makes for a nice effect.
I also like that when you move the mouse around over an image, the photo shifts ever so slightly which gives the page dimension even though its very subtle.</p>

         <p>On this site I really enjoy the animation, which is of drawings being done in front of you. I also really like the navigation that appears once you've made it to the bottom the page. I find this quite convenient because you don't need to scroll back up to the top of the page to then switch to another page.</p>

         <p>  On this site I really like that when you scroll a bunch of scattered images move towards each other until they've formed well known faces. It is a creative concept that goes quite well with the site's catch phrase, "millions of images. endless possibilities."</p>
